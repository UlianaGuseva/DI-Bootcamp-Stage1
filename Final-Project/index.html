            <figure>I don't have an idol in my life. I don't admire any singer, I'm not crazy about actors, I don't like one particular writer or poet, I don't know much about cult personalities. But I know one thing. Each of us has something special, a certain magic with which we came into this world. Therefore, this page is dedicated to magic.</figure>
            <p>Imagine there's no countries <br>
            It isn't hard to do <br>
            Nothing to kill or die for <br>
            And no religion, too <br>
            Imagine all the people <br>
            Livin' life in peace
